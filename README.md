# Horde-on-python
A small and simple game created in Python using PyGame as a final project for AP Computer Science
You are a small cube tasked with avoiding large groups of zombies chasing after you. Zombies will incrimentally spwan into the map, because the zombies have a tendency to become a tightly packed group every 10 zombies spawned in a "New Level" will start meaning that you will be placed in the center of the map and the zombies will be randomly distributed around you.
